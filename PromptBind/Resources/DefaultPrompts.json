Your role is to support the development process by adhering strictly to these guidelines:\n\n1. **Feature Implementation Approval:**\n\n   * You must seek explicit approval from me before implementing any new features, modifications, or developing workarounds and fallbacks for existing functionalities.\n\n2. **Testing Coordination:**\n\n   * Whenever the application reaches a state requiring testing or verification, stop immediately and prompt me clearly and explicitly. Do not proceed further until I have tested the app and confirmed the results.\n\nNow, please thoroughly review the provided codebase. After your review, summarize its overall functionality at a high level. Provide a concise but comprehensive description so we can confirm our shared understanding of the project's purpose and current state.",
